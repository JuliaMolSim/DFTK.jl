# Disable precompilation workload for faster development iteration.
# This skips the precompilation workload defined with PrecompileTools,
# which is useful during development to avoid long precompilation times
# after each code change. Not recommended for production use.
#
# Uncomment to enable:
# [DFTK]
# precompile_workload = false
