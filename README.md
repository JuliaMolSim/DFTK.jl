The density-functional toolkit, **DFTK** for short, is a collection of
Julia routines for experimentation with plane-wave density-functional theory (DFT).
The unique feature of this code is its emphasis on simplicity and flexibility
with the goal of facilitating algorithmic and numerical developments as well as
interdisciplinary collaboration in solid-state research.

Having started in 2018 we already support a
[sizeable set of features](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/index.html#package-features-1).
Within the system size currently accessible to our code (ca. 1000 electrons)
our performance is of the same order of magnitude as more established packages
such as [Abinit](https://www.abinit.org/) or 
[Quantum Espresso](http://quantum-espresso.org/).

For getting started with DFTK, see [our documentation](https://docs.dftk.org):
- [Installation instructions](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/guide/installation/)
- [Tutorial](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/guide/tutorial/)
- [Examples](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/#example-index-1)

Note that at least **Julia 1.6** is required.


## DFTK summer school 2022

We will organise a summer school centred around the DFTK code
and modern numerical approaches to density-functional theory
from **29 to 31 August 2022** at **Sorbonne Université, Paris**.
For more details see the [school's website](https://school2022.dftk.org).


## Support and citation
DFTK is mostly developed as part of academic research.
Parts of DFTK have also been discussed in published papers.
If you use our code as part of your research, teaching or other activities,
we would be grateful if you cite them as appropriate.
See the [CITATION.bib](CITATION.bib) in the root of this repo for relevant references.
The current DFTK reference paper to cite is
[![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.21105/jcon.00069-blue)](https://doi.org/10.21105/jcon.00069).

## Funding
This project has received funding from
the [Institute of computing and data sciences (ISCD, Sorbonne Université)](https://iscd.sorbonne-universite.fr/),
[École des Ponts ParisTech](https://enpc.fr), [Inria Research Centre Paris](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris),
[RWTH Aachen University](https://rwth-aachen.de/),
and from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and
innovation program ([grant agreement No 810367](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/810367)).

## Contributing
If you stumble across issues in using DFTK
or have suggestions for future developments
we are more than happy to hear about it.
In this case please [open an issue](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/DFTK.jl/issues)
or contact us ([@mfherbst](https://github.com/mfherbst)
and [@antoine-levitt](https://github.com/antoine-levitt)) directly.

Contributions to the code in any form is very welcome,
just [submit a pull request](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/DFTK.jl/pulls)
on github. If you want to contribute but are unsure where to start, take a look
at the list of issues tagged [good first issue](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/DFTK.jl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
(relatively easy tasks suitable for newcomers) or [help wanted](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/DFTK.jl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
(more sizeable but well-defined and isolated).
Don't hesitate to ask for help, through github, email or the [JuliaMolSim slack][slack-url].
