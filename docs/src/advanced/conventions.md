# Notation and conventions

## Usage of unicode characters
DFTK liberally uses unicode characters to represent Greek characters
(e.g. ψ, ρ, ε...). Make sure you use the proper
[Julia plugins](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/)
to simplify typing them.

## [Symbol conventions](@id symbol-conventions)

- **Reciprocal-space vectors:** ``k`` for vectors in the Brillouin zone,
  ``G`` for vectors of the reciprocal lattice,
  ``q`` for general vectors
- **Real-space vectors:** ``R`` for lattice vectors,
  ``r`` and ``x`` are usually used for unit for vectors in the unit cell
  or general real-space vectors, respectively.
  This convention is, however, less consistently applied.
- ``\Omega`` is the unit cell, and ``|\Omega|``
  (or sometimes just ``\Omega``) is its volume.
- ``A`` are the real-space lattice vectors (`model.lattice`)
  and ``B`` the Brillouin zone lattice vectors (`model.recip_lattice`).
- The **Bloch waves** are
  ```math
  \psi_{nk}(x) = e^{ik\cdot x} u_{nk}(x),
  ```
  where ``n`` is the band index and ``k`` the ``k``-point. In the code we
  sometimes use ``\psi`` and ``u`` interchangeably.
- ``\varepsilon`` are the **eigenvalues**,
  ``\varepsilon_F`` is the **Fermi level**.
- ``\rho`` is the **density**.
- In the code we use **normalized plane waves**:
  ```math
  e_G(r) = \frac 1 {\sqrt{\Omega}} e^{i G \cdot r}.
  ```
- ``Y^l_m`` are the complex **spherical harmonics**, and ``Y_{lm}`` the real ones.
- ``j_l`` are the **Bessel functions**. In particular, ``j_{0}(x) = \frac{\sin x}{x}``.

## Units
In DFTK, atomic units are used throughout, most importantly
lengths are in Bohr and energies in Hartree.
See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree_atomic_units)
for a list of conversion factors. Appropriate unit conversion can
can be performed using the `Unitful` and `UnitfulAtomic` packages:

```@example
using Unitful
using UnitfulAtomic
austrip(10u"eV")      # 10eV in Hartree
```
```@example
using Unitful: Å
using UnitfulAtomic
auconvert(Å, 1.2)  # 1.2 Bohr in Ångström
```

!!! warning "Differing unit conventions"
    Different electronic-structure codes use different unit conventions.
    For example for lattice vectors the common length units
    are Bohr (used by DFTK) and Ångström (used e.g. by ASE, 1Å ≈ 1.80 Bohr).
    When setting up a calculation for DFTK
    one needs to ensure to convert to Bohr and atomic units.
    For some Python libraries (currently ASE, pymatgen and abipy)
    DFTK directly ships conversion tools in form of the [`load_lattice`](@ref)
    and [`load_atoms`](@ref) functions,
    which take care of such conversions. Examples which demonstrate this
    are [Creating slabs with ASE](@ref) and [Creating supercells with pymatgen](@ref).

## [Lattices and lattice vectors](@id conventions-lattice)
Both the real-space lattice (i.e. `model.lattice`) and reciprocal-space lattice
(`model.recip_lattice`) contain the lattice vectors in columns. If 1D or 2D
problems are to be treated these arrays are still ``3 \times 3`` matrices,
but contain two or one zero-columns, respectively.
The real-space lattice vectors are sometimes referred to by ``A`` and the
reciprocal-space lattice vectors by ``B = 2\pi A^{-T}``.


!!! warning "Row-major versus column-major storage order"
    Julia stores matrices as column-major, but other languages
    (notably Python and C) use row-major ordering.
    Care therefore needs to be taken to properly
    transpose the unit cell matrices ``A`` before using it with DFTK.
    For the supported third-party packages `load_lattice`
    and `load_atoms` again handle such conversion automatically.

We use the convention that the unit cell in real space is
``[0, 1)^3`` in reduced coordinates and the unit cell in reciprocal
space (the reducible Brillouin zone) is ``[-1/2, 1/2)^3``.

## Reduced and cartesian coordinates
Unless denoted otherwise the code uses **reduced coordinates**
for reciprocal-space vectors such as ``k``,  ``G``, ``q``
or real-space vectors like ``r`` and ``R``
(see [Symbol conventions](@ref symbol-conventions)).
One switches to Cartesian coordinates by
```math
x_\text{cart} = M x_\text{red}
```
where ``M`` is either ``A`` / `model.lattice` (for real-space vectors) or
``B`` / `model.recip_lattice` (for reciprocal-space vectors).
A useful relationship is
```math
b_\text{cart} \cdot a_\text{cart}=2\pi b_\text{red} \cdot a_\text{red}
```
if ``a`` and ``b`` are real-space and reciprocal-space vectors respectively.
Other names for reduced coordinates are **integer coordinates**
(usually for ``G``-vectors) or **fractional coordinates**
(usually for ``k``-points).

## Normalization conventions
The normalization conventions used in the code is that quantities
stored in reciprocal space are coefficients in the ``e_{G}`` basis,
and quantities stored in real space use real physical values.
This means for instance that wavefunctions in the real space grid are
normalized as ``\frac{|\Omega|}{N} \sum_{r} |\psi(r)|^{2} = 1`` where
``N`` is the number of grid points
and in reciprocal space its coefficients are ``\ell^{2}``-normalized,
see the discussion in section [`PlaneWaveBasis` and plane-wave discretisations](@ref)
where this is demonstrated.
