# API reference

This page provides a plain list of all documented functions, structs,
modules and macros in DFTK. Note that this list is neither structured,
complete nor particularly clean, so it only provides rough orientation
at the moment. The best reference is the code itself.

```@autodocs
Modules = [DFTK, DFTK.Smearing]
```
