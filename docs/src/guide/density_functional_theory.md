# Introductory resources on density-functional theory and DFTK

This page collects a bunch of lecture notes and recordings
related to density-functional theory (DFT) and DFTK.
Since DFTK aims for an interdisciplinary audience the
level and scope of the notes vary a bit.
They are roughly ordered from beginner to advanced.
For a list of
articles dealing with novel research aspects achieved using DFTK,
see [Publications](@ref).


- [DFTK: A Julian approach for simulating electrons in solids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RomkxjlIcQ):
  Pre-recorded talk for JuliaCon 2020.
  Assumes no knowledge about DFT and gives the broad picture of DFTK.
  [Slides](https://michael-herbst.com/talks/2020.07.29_juliacon_dftk.pdf).

- [Introduction to plane-wave DFT and DFTK](https://github.com/mfherbst/aachen_introduction_dftk):
  Jupyter notebooks a two-hour lecture
  introducing plane-wave DFT and DFTK
  to an interdisciplinary audience of undergrads.
  You can also run the notebooks interactively
  [on binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mfherbst/aachen_introduction_dftk/master).
