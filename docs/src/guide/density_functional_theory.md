# [Introductory resources on density-functional theory and DFTK](@id density-functional-theory)

This page collects a bunch of lecture notes, textbooks and recordings
related to density-functional theory (DFT) and DFTK.
Since DFTK aims for an interdisciplinary audience the
level and scope of the referenced works varies.
They are roughly ordered from beginner to advanced.
For a list of articles dealing with novel research aspects achieved using DFTK,
see [Publications](@ref).

- [DFTK: A Julian approach for simulating electrons in solids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RomkxjlIcQ) by M. F. Herbst:
  Pre-recorded talk for JuliaCon 2020.
  Assumes no knowledge about DFT and gives the broad picture of DFTK.
  [Slides](https://michael-herbst.com/talks/2020.07.29_juliacon_dftk.pdf).

- [Introduction to plane-wave DFT and DFTK](https://github.com/mfherbst/aachen_introduction_dftk) by M. F. Herbst:
  Jupyter notebooks a two-hour lecture
  introducing plane-wave DFT and DFTK
