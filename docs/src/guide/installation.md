# Installation

In case you don't have a working Julia installation yet, first
[download the Julia binaries](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
and follow the [Julia installation instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/).
At least **Julia 1.4** is required for DFTK.

Afterwards you can install DFTK
[like any other package](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/getting-started/)
in Julia. For example run in your Julia REPL terminal:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("DFTK")
```
which will install the latest DFTK release.
Alternatively (if you like to be fully up to date) install the master branch:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(name="DFTK", rev="master")
```

DFTK is continuously tested on Debian, Ubuntu, mac OS and Windows and should work on
these operating systems out of the box.

## Python dependencies
Some parts of the code require a working Python installation with the
[`pymatgen`](https://pymatgen.org/) module.
Check out which version of python is used by the
[PyCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) package.
You can do this for example with the Julia commands
```julia
using PyCall
PyCall.python
```
Then use the corresponding package manager (usually `apt`, `pip`, `pip3` or `conda`)
to install aforementioned libraries, for example
```
pip install pymatgen
```
or
```
conda install -c conda-forge pymatgen
```
Afterwards you're all set and should be able to
run the code in the [`examples` directory](https://dftk.org/tree/master/examples).

## Developer setup
If you want to start developing DFTK Julia has the option to
automatically keep track of the changes of the sources during development.
This means, for example, that
[`Revise`](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl) will automatically be aware
of the changes you make to the DFTK sources and automatically
reload your changes inside an active Julia session.
To achieve such a setup you have two recommended options:

1. Add a development version of DFTK to the global Julia environment:
   ```julia
   import Pkg
   Pkg.develop("DFTK")
   ```
   This clones DFTK to the path `~/.julia/dev/DFTK"` (on Linux).
   Note that with this method you cannot install both the stable
   and the development version of DFTK into your global environment.

2. Clone [DFTK](https://dftk.org) into a location of your choice
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/DFTK.jl /some/path/
   ```
   Whenever you want to use exactly this development version of DFTK
   in a [Julia environment](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/environments/)
   (e.g. the global one) add it as a `develop` package:
   ```julia
   import Pkg
   Pkg.develop("/some/path/")
   ```
   To run a script or start a Julia REPL using exactly this source tree
   as the DFTK version, use the `--project` flag of Julia,
   see [this documentation](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/environments/)
   for details. For example to start a Julia REPL with this version of DFTK use
   ```bash
   $ julia --project=/some/path/
   ```
   The advantage of this method is that you can easily have multiple
   clones of DFTK with potentially different modifications made.
