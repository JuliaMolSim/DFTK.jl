# DFTK.jl: The density-functional toolkit.

The density-functional toolkit, **DFTK** for short, is a library of
Julia routines for playing with plane-wave
density-functional theory (DFT) algorithms.
In its basic formulation it solves periodic Kohn-Sham equations.
The unique feature of the code is its **emphasis on simplicity
and flexibility**
with the goal of facilitating methodological development and
interdisciplinary collaboration.
In about 7k lines of pure Julia code
we support a [sizeable set of features](@ref package-features).
Our performance is of the same order of magnitude as much larger production
codes such as [Abinit](https://www.abinit.org/),
[Quantum Espresso](http://quantum-espresso.org/) and
[VASP](https://www.vasp.at/).
DFTK's source code is [publicly available on github](https://dftk.org).

If you are new to density-functional theory or plane-wave methods,
see our notes on [Periodic problems](@ref periodic-problems) and our
collection of [lectures, workshops and literature on DFT](@ref density-functional-theory).

!!! tip "DFTK summer school: 29th to 31st August 2022 in Paris, France"
    We will organise a summer school centred around the DFTK code
    and modern approaches to density-functional theory
    from **29 to 31 August 2022** at **Sorbonne Universit√©, Paris**.
    For more details and registration info see the [school's website](https://school2022.dftk.org).

## [Package features](@id package-features)
* Methods and models:
    - Standard DFT models (LDA, GGA, meta-GGA): Any functional from the
      [libxc](https://tddft.org/programs/libxc/) library
    - Flexibility to build your own Kohn-Sham model:
      Anything from analytic potentials, linear Cohen-Bergstresser models,
      Gross-Pitaevskii equations, anyonic models, etc.
    - Analytic potentials or Godecker norm-conserving pseudopotentials (GTH, HGH)
    - Brillouin zone symmetry for ``k``-point sampling using [spglib](https://atztogo.github.io/spglib/)
    - Standard smearing functions (including Methfessel-Paxton
      and Marzari-Vanderbilt cold smearing)
    - Collinear spin polarization for magnetic systems
    - Self-consistent field approaches including Kerker mixing,
      [LDOS mixing](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/abcbdb),
      [adaptive damping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14018)
    - Direct minimization, Newton solver
    - Multi-level threading (``k``-points eigenvectors, FFTs, linear algebra)
    - MPI-based distributed parallelism (distribution over ``k``-points)
    - 1D / 2D / 3D systems
    - External magnetic fields
    - Treat systems of 1000 electrons
* Ground-state properties and post-processing:
    - Total energy
    - Forces, stresses
    - Density of states (DOS), local density of states (LDOS)
    - Band structures
    - Easy access to all intermediate quantities (e.g. density, Bloch waves)
* Support for arbitrary floating point types, including `Float32` (single precision)
  or `Double64` (from [DoubleFloats.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/DoubleFloats.jl)).
* Runs out of the box on Linux, macOS and Windows
* Third-party integrations:
    - Seamless integration with many standard [Input and output formats](@ref).
    - Use structures prepared in [pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org) or
      [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/).
    - [asedftk](https://github.com/mfherbst/asedftk):
      DFTK-based calculator implementation for ASE.

These and more examples can be found in the
[`examples` directory](https://dftk.org/tree/master/examples) of the main code.


!!! note "Convergence parameters in the documentation"
    In the documentation we use very rough convergence parameters to be able
    to automatically generate this documentation very quickly.
    Therefore results are far from converged.
    Tighter thresholds and larger grids should be used for
    more realistic results.
