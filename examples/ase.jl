# # Creating slabs with ASE
#
# ASE is short for the
# [atomistic simulation environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html),
# a Python package to simplify the process of setting up, running and
# analysing results from atomistic simulations across different programs.
# Extremely powerful in this respect are the routines this code provides
# for setting up complicated systems (including surface-adsorption scenarios,
# defects, nanotubes, etc).
# See also the [ASE installation instructions](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/install.html).
#
# This example shows how to use ASE to setup a particular gallium arsenide surface
# and run the resulting calculation in DFTK.
# If you are less interested in having access to the full playground of options in DFTK,
# but more interested in performing analysis in ASE itself,
# have a look at [asedftk](https://github.com/mfherbst/asedftk).
# This package provides an ASE-compatible calculator class based on DFTK,
# such that one may write the usual Python scripts against ASE,
# but the calculations are still run in DFTK.
#
# The particular example we consider the (1, 1, 0) GaAs surface separated by vacuum
# with the setup slightly adapted from [^RCW2001].

# Parameters of the calculation. Since this surface is far from easy to converge,
# we made the problem simpler by choosing a smaller `Ecut` and smaller values
# for `n_GaAs` and `n_vacuum`.
# More interesting settings are `Ecut = 15` and `n_GaAs = n_vacuum = 20`.
#
miller = (1, 1, 0)   # Surface Miller indices
n_GaAs = 2           # Number of GaAs layers
n_vacuum = 4         # Number of vacuum layers
Ecut = 5             # Hartree
kgrid = (4, 4, 1);   # Monkhorst-Pack mesh

# Use ASE to build the structure:
using PyCall

ase_build = pyimport("ase.build")
a = 5.6537  # GaAs lattice parameter in Ångström (because ASE uses Å as length unit)
gaas = ase_build.bulk("GaAs", "zincblende", a=a)
surface = ase_build.surface(gaas, miller, n_GaAs, 0, periodic=true);

# Get the amount of vacuum in Ångström we need to add
d_vacuum = maximum(maximum, surface.cell) / n_GaAs * n_vacuum
surface = ase_build.surface(gaas, miller, n_GaAs, d_vacuum, periodic=true);

# Write an image of the surface and embed it as a nice illustration:
pyimport("ase.io").write("surface.png", surface * (3, 3, 1),
                         rotation="-90x, 30y, -75z")

# Use the `load_atoms` and `load_lattice` functions
# to convert to DFTK datastructures.
# These two functions not only support importing ASE atoms into DFTK,
# but a few more third-party datastructures as well.
# Typically the imported `atoms` use a bare Coulomb potential,
# such that appropriate pseudopotentials need to be attached in a post-step:

atoms = load_atoms(surface)
atoms = [ElementPsp(el.symbol, psp=load_psp(el.symbol, functional="pbe")) => position
         for (el, position) in atoms]
lattice = load_lattice(surface);

# We model this surface with (quite large a) temperature of 0.01 Hartree
# to ease convergence. Try lowering the SCF convergence tolerance (`tol`
# or the `temperature` to see the full challenge of this system.

                  temperature=0.001, smearing=DFTK.Smearing.Gaussian())
