# # Performing a convergence study
#
# This example shows how to perform a convergence study to find an appropriate
# discretisation parameters for the Brillouin zone (`kgrid`) and kinetic energy
# cutoff (`Ecut`), such that the simulation results are converged to a desired
# accuracy tolerance.
#
# Such a convergence study is generally performed by starting with a
# reasonable base line value for `kgrid` and `Ecut` and then increasing these
# parameters (i.e. using finer discretisations) until a desired property (such
# as the energy) changes less than the tolerance.
#
# This procedure must be performed for each discretisation parameter. Beyond
# the `Ecut` and the `kgrid` also convergence in the smearing temperature or
# other numerical parameters should be checked. For simplicity we will neglect
# this aspect in this example and concentrate on `Ecut` and `kgrid`. Moreover
# we will restrict ourselves to using the same number of ``k``-points in each
# dimension of the Brillouin zone.
#
# As the objective of this study we consider bulk platinum. For running the SCF
# conveniently we define a function:

using DFTK
using LinearAlgebra
using Statistics

function run_scf(; a=5.0, Ecut, nkpt, tol)
    atoms    = [ElementPsp(:Pt; psp=load_psp("hgh/lda/Pt-q10"))]
    position = [zeros(3)]
    lattice  = a * Matrix(I, 3, 3)

    model  = model_DFT(lattice, atoms, position;
                       functionals=LDA(), temperature=1e-2)
    basis  = PlaneWaveBasis(model; Ecut, kgrid=(nkpt, nkpt, nkpt))
    println("nkpt = $nkpt Ecut = $Ecut")
    self_consistent_field(basis; is_converged=ScfConvergenceEnergy(tol))
end;

# Moreover we define some parameters. To make the calculations run fast for the
# automatic generation of this documentation we target only a convergence to
# 1e-2. In practice smaller tolerances (and thus larger upper bounds for
# `nkpts` and `Ecuts` are likely needed.
tol   = 1e-2      # Tolerance to which we target to converge
nkpts = 1:7       # K-point range checked for convergence
Ecuts = 10:2:24;  # Energy cutoff range checked for convergence

# As the first step we converge in the number of ``k``-points employed in each
# dimension of the Brillouin zone …
function converge_kgrid(nkpts; Ecut, tol)
    energies = [run_scf(; nkpt, tol=tol/10, Ecut).energies.total for nkpt in nkpts]
    errors = abs.(energies[1:end-1] .- energies[end])
    iconv = findfirst(errors .< tol)
    (; nkpts=nkpts[1:end-1], errors, nkpt_conv=nkpts[iconv])
end
result = converge_kgrid(nkpts; Ecut=mean(Ecuts), tol)
nkpt_conv = result.nkpt_conv

# … and plot the obtained convergence:
using Plots
plot(result.nkpts, result.errors, dpi=300, lw=3, m=:o, yaxis=:log,
     xlabel="k-grid", ylabel="energy absolute error")

# We continue to do the convergence in Ecut using the suggested ``k``-point grid.
function converge_Ecut(Ecuts; nkpt, tol)
    energies = [run_scf(; nkpt, tol=tol/100, Ecut).energies.total for Ecut in Ecuts]
    errors = abs.(energies[1:end-1] .- energies[end])
    iconv = findfirst(errors .< tol)
    (; Ecuts=Ecuts[1:end-1], errors, Ecut_conv=Ecuts[iconv])
end
result = converge_Ecut(Ecuts; nkpt=nkpt_conv, tol)
Ecut_conv = result.Ecut_conv

# … and plot it:
plot(result.Ecuts, result.errors, dpi=300, lw=3, m=:o, yaxis=:log,
     xlabel="Ecut", ylabel="energy absolute error")

# ## A more realistic example.
# Repeating the above exercise for more realistic settings, namely …
tol   = 1e-4  # Tolerance to which we target to converge
nkpts = 1:20  # K-point range checked for convergence
Ecuts = 20:1:50;

# …one obtains the following two plots for the convergence in `kpoints` and `Ecut`.
