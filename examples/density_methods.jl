# # Density Guesses

# We compare four different approaches to charge density initialization for starting a
# density-based SCF.

# First we set up our problem

import Main: @artifact_str # hide

# We use a numeric norm-conserving PSP in UPF format from the
# [PseudoDojo](http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/) v0.4 scalar-relativistic LDA standard stringency
# family because it contains valence charge density which can be used for a more tailored
# density guess.

# ## Random guess
# The random density is normalized to the number of electrons provided.

# ## Superposition of Gaussian densities
# The Gaussians are defined by a tabulated atom decay length.
results["Gaussian"] = silicon_scf(ValenceDensityGaussian());

# ## Pseudopotential density guess
# If you'd like to force the use of pseudopotential atomic densities, you can use
# the `ValenceDensityPseudo()` method. Note that this will fail if any of the
# pseudopotentials don't provide atomic valence charge densities!
results["Pseudo"] = silicon_scf(ValenceDensityPseudo());

# ## Automatic density guess
# This method will automatically use valence charge densities from from pseudopotentials
# that provide them and Gaussian densities for elements which do not have pseudopotentials
# or whose pseudopotentials don't provide valence charge densities.
