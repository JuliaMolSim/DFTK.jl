# # Energy cutoff smearing
#
# A technique that has been employed in the literature to ensure smooth energy bands
# for finite Ecut values is energy cutoff smearing.
#
# As recalled in the
# [Problems and plane-wave discretization](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/guide/periodic_problems/)
# section, the energy of periodic systems is computed by solving eigenvalue
# problems of the form
# ```math
# H_k u_k = ε_k u_k,
# ```
# for each ``k``-point in the first Brillouin zone of the system.
# Each of these eigenvalue problem is discretized with a plane-wave basis
# ``\mathcal{B}_k^{E_c}=\{x ↦ e^{iG · x} \;\;|\;G ∈ \mathcal{R}^*,\;\; |k+G|^2 ≤ 2E_c\}``
# whose size highly depends on the choice of ``k``-point, cell size or
# cutoff energy ``\rm E_c`` (the `Ecut` parameter of DFTK).
# As a result, energy bands computed along a ``k``-path in the Brillouin zone
# or with respect to the system's unit cell volume - in the case of geometry optimization
# for example - display big irregularities when `Ecut` is taken too small.
#
# Here is for example the variation of the ground state energy of diamond silicon
# with respect to its lattice parameter, around the experimental lattice constant.

# The problem of non-smoothness of the approximated energy is typically avoided by
# taking a large enough `Ecut`, at the cost of a high computation time.
# Another method consist in introducing a modified kinetic term defined through
# the data of a blow-up function, a method which is also referred to as "energy cutoff
# smearing". DFTK features energy cutoff smearing using the CHV blow-up
# function introduced in [^CHV2024] that is mathematically ensured to provide ``C^2``
# regularity of the energy bands.

# !!! note "Abinit energy cutoff smearing option"
#     For the sake of completeness, DFTK also provides the blow-up function `BlowupAbinit`
#     proposed in the Abinit quantum chemistry code. This function depends on a parameter
#     `Ecutsm` fixed by the user
#     (see [Abinit user guide](https://docs.abinit.org/variables/rlx/#ecutsm)).
#     For the right choice of `Ecutsm`, `BlowupAbinit` corresponds to the `BlowupCHV` approach
#     with coefficients ensuring ``C^1`` regularity. To choose `BlowupAbinit`, pass
#     `kinetic_blowup=BlowupAbinit(Ecutsm)` to the model constructors.
#

# We can now compare the approximation of the energy as well as the estimated
# lattice constant for each strategy.
