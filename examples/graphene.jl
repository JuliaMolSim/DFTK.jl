# # Graphene band structure

# This example plots the band structure of graphene, a 2D material. 2D band
# structures are not supported natively (yet), so we manually build a custom
# path in reciprocal space.

## Define the convergence parameters (these should be increased in production)
L = 20  # height of the simulation box
kgrid = [6, 6, 1]
Ecut = 15
temperature = 1e-3

## Define the geometry and pseudopotential
a = 4.66  # lattice constant
a1 = a*[1/2,-sqrt(3)/2, 0]
a2 = a*[1/2, sqrt(3)/2, 0]
a3 = L*[0  , 0        , 1]

## Run SCF
