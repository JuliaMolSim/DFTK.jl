# # Polarizability by linear response
#
# We compute the polarizability of a Helium atom. The polarizability
# is defined as the change in dipole moment
# ```math
# \mu = \int r ρ(r) dr
# ```
# with respect to a small uniform electric field ``E = -x``.
#
# We compute this in two ways: first by finite differences (applying a
# finite electric field), then by linear response. Note that DFTK is
# not really adapted to isolated atoms because it uses periodic
# boundary conditions. Nevertheless we can simply embed the Helium
# atom in a large enough box (although this is computationally wasteful).
#
# As in other tests, this is not fully converged, convergence
# parameters were simply selected for fast execution on CI,

# ## Using finite differences
# We first compute the polarizability by finite differences.
# First compute the dipole moment at rest:
model = model_LDA(lattice, atoms; symmetries=false)
basis = PlaneWaveBasis(model; Ecut, kgrid)
res   = self_consistent_field(basis, tol=tol)
μref  = dipole(basis, res.ρ)

# Then in a small uniform field:
ε = .01
model_ε = model_LDA(lattice, atoms; extra_terms=[ExternalFromReal(r -> -ε * (r[1] - a/2))],
                    symmetries=false)

println("Reference dipole:  $μref")
println("Displaced dipole:  $με")

# The result on more converged grids is very close to published results.
# For example [DOI 10.1039/C8CP03569E](https://doi.org/10.1039/C8CP03569E)
# quotes **1.65** with LSDA and **1.38** with CCSD(T).

# ## Using linear response
# Now we use linear response to compute this analytically; we refer to standard
# textbooks for the formalism. In the following, ``\chi_0`` is the
# independent-particle polarizability, and ``K`` the
# Hartree-exchange-correlation kernel. We denote with ``\delta V_{\rm ext}`` an external
# perturbing potential (like in this case the uniform electric field). Then:
# ```math
# \delta\rho = \chi_0 \delta V = \chi_0 (\delta V_{\rm ext} + K \delta\rho),
# ```
# which implies
# ```math
# \delta\rho = (1-\chi_0 K)^{-1} \chi_0 \delta V_{\rm ext}.
# ```
# From this we identify the polarizability operator to be ``\chi = (1-\chi_0 K)^{-1} \chi_0``.
# Numerically, we apply ``\chi`` to ``\delta V = -x`` by solving a linear equation
# (the Dyson equation) iteratively.

println("Non-interacting polarizability: $(dipole(basis, δρ_nointeract))")

# As expected, the interacting polarizability matches the finite difference
# result. The non-interacting polarizability is higher.
