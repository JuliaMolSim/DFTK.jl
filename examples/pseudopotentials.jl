# # Pseudopotentials
#
# In this example, we'll look at how to use various pseudopotential (PSP)
# formats in DFTK and discuss briefly the utility and importance of
# pseudopotentials.
#
# Currently, DFTK supports norm-conserving (NC) PSPs in
# separable (Kleinman-Bylander) form. Two file formats can currently
# be read and used: analytical Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter (HGH) PSPs
# and numeric Unified Pseudopotential Format (UPF) PSPs.
#
# In brief, the pseudopotential approach replaces the all-electron
# atomic potential with an effective atomic potential. In this pseudopotential,
# tightly-bound core electrons are completely eliminated ("frozen") and
# chemically-active valence electron wavefunctions are replaced with
# smooth pseudo-wavefunctions whose Fourier representations decay quickly.
# Both these transformations aim at reducing the number of Fourier modes required
# to accurately represent the wavefunction of the system, greatly increasing
# computational efficiency.
#
# Different PSP generation codes produce various file formats which contain the
# same general quantities required for pesudopotential evaluation. HGH PSPs
# are constructed from a fixed functional form based on Gaussians, and the files
# simply tablulate various coefficients fitted for a given element. UPF PSPs
# take a more flexible approach where the functional form used to generate the
# PSP is arbitrary, and the resulting functions are tabulated on a radial grid
# in the file. The UPF file format is documented here:
# http://pseudopotentials.quantum-espresso.org/home/unified-pseudopotential-format.
#
# In this example, we will compare the convergence of an analytical HGH PSP with
# a modern numeric norm-conserving PSP in UPF format from
# [PseudoDojo](http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/).
# Then, we will compare the bandstructure at the converged parameters calculated
# using the two PSPs.

# Here, we will use a Perdew-Wang LDA PSP from [PseudoDojo](http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/),
# which is available in the JuliaMolSim
# [PseudoLibrary](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/PseudoLibrary).
# Directories in PseudoLibrary correspond to artifacts that you can load using `artifact`
# strings which evaluate to a filepath on your local machine where the artifact has been
# downloaded.

# We load the HGH and UPF PSPs using `load_psp`, which determines the
# file format using the file extension.

psp_hgh  = load_psp("hgh/lda/si-q4.hgh");
psp_upf  = load_psp(joinpath(artifact"pd_nc_sr_lda_standard_0.4.1_upf", "Si.upf"));

# First, we'll take a look at the energy cutoff convergence of these two pseudopotentials.
# For both pseudos, a reference energy is calculated with a cutoff of 140 Hartree, and
# SCF calculations are run at increasing cutoffs until 1 meV / atom convergence is reached.

# The converged cutoffs are 26 Ha and 18 Ha for the HGH
# and UPF pseudos respectively. We see that the HGH pseudopotential
# is much *harder*, i.e. it requires a higher energy cutoff, than the UPF PSP. In general,
# numeric pseudopotentials tend to be softer than analytical pseudos because of the
# flexibility of sampling arbitrary functions on a grid.

# Next, to see that the different pseudopotentials give reasonbly similar results,
# we'll look at the bandstructures calculated using the HGH and UPF PSPs. Even though
# the convered cutoffs are higher, we perform these calculations with a cutoff of
# 12 Ha for both PSPs.
