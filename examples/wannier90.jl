# # Wannierization using Wannier90
#
# DFTK features an interface with the program
# [Wannier90](http://www.wannier.org/),
# in order to compute maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs)
# from an initial self consistent field calculation.
# All processes are handled by calling the routine `run_wannier90`.
#
# !!! warning "No guarantees on Wannier90 interface"
#     This code is at an early stage and has so far not been fully tested.
#     Bugs are likely and we welcome issues in case you find any!
#
# This example shows how to obtain the MLWFs corresponding
# to the first five bands of graphene. Since the bands 2 to 11 are entangled,
# 15 bands are first computed to obtain 5 MLWFs by a disantanglement procedure.

# Now we use the `run_wannier90` routine to generate all files needed by
# wannier90 and to perform the wannierization procedure.
# In Wannier90's convention, all files are named with the same prefix and only differ by
# their extensions. By default all generated input and output files are stored
# in the subfolder "wannier90" under the prefix "wannier" (i.e. "wannier90/wannier.win",
# "wannier90/wannier.wout", etc.). A different file prefix can be given with the
# keyword argument `fileprefix` as shown below.

# We now solve for 5 MLWF using wannier90:
