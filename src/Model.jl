    Model(lattice, atoms, positions; n_electrons, magnetic_moments, terms, temperature,
          smearing, spin_polarization, symmetries)

Creates the physical specification of a model (without any discretization information).

`n_electrons` is taken from `atoms` if not specified.

`spin_polarization` is :none by default (paired electrons)
unless any of the elements has a non-zero initial magnetic moment.
In this case the spin_polarization will be :collinear.

`magnetic_moments` is only used to determine the symmetry and the
`spin_polarization`; it is not stored inside the datastructure.

`smearing` is Fermi-Dirac if `temperature` is non-zero, none otherwise

The `symmetries` kwarg allows (a) to pass `true` / `false` to enable / disable
the automatic determination of lattice symmetries or (b) to pass an explicit list
of symmetry operations to use for lowering the computational effort.
The default behaviour is equal to `true`, namely that the code checks the
specified model in form of the Hamiltonian `terms`, `lattice`, `atoms` and `magnetic_moments`
parameters and from these automatically determines a set of symmetries it can safely use.
If you want to pass custom symmetry operations (e.g. a reduced or extended set) use the
`symmetry_operations` function. Notice that this may lead to wrong results if e.g. the
external potential breaks some of the passed symmetries. Use `false` to turn off
symmetries completely.

There are two types of quantities, depending on how they transform under change of coordinates.

Positions transform with the lattice: r_cart = lattice * r_red. We term them vectors.

Linear forms on vectors (anything that appears in an expression f⋅r) transform
with the inverse lattice transpose: if f_cart ⋅ r_cart = f_red ⋅ r_red, then
f_cart = lattice' \ f_red. We term them covectors.
Examples of covectors are forces.

Reciprocal vectors are a special case: they are covectors, but conventionally have an
additional factor of 2π in their definition, so they transform rather with 2π times the
inverse lattice transpose: q_cart = 2π lattice' \ q_red = recip_lattice * q_red.

vector_red_to_cart(model::Model, rred)        = model.lattice * rred

covector_red_to_cart(model::Model, fred)      = model.inv_lattice' * fred
covector_cart_to_red(model::Model, fcart)     = model.lattice' * fcart
recip_vector_red_to_cart(model::Model, qred)  = model.recip_lattice * qred
recip_vector_cart_to_red(model::Model, qcart) = model.inv_recip_lattice * qcart

#=
Transformations on vectors and covectors are matrices and comatrices.

Consider two covectors f and g related by a transformation matrix B. In reduced
coordinates g_red = B_red f_red and in cartesian coordinates we want g_cart = B_cart f_cart.
From g_cart = L⁻ᵀ g_red = L⁻ᵀ B_red f_red = L⁻ᵀ B_red Lᵀ f_cart, we see B_cart = L⁻ᵀ B_red Lᵀ.

Similarly for two vectors r and s with s_red = A_red r_red and s_cart = A_cart r_cart:
s_cart = L s_red = L A_red r_red = L A_red L⁻¹ r_cart, thus A_cart = L A_red L⁻¹.

Examples of matrices are the symmetries in real space (W)
Examples of comatrices are the symmetries in reciprocal space (S)
