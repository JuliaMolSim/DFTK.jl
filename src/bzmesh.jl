    bzmesh_uniform(kgrid_size)

Construct a uniform Brillouin zone mesh for sampling the ``k``-Points. The function
returns a tuple `(kcoords, ksymops)`, where `kcoords` are the list of ``k``-Points
and `ksymops` are a list of symmetry operations (for interface compatibility
with `PlaneWaveBasis` and `bzmesh_irreducible`. No symmetry reduction is attempted,
such that there will be `prod(kgrid_size)` ``k``-Points returned and all symmetry
operations are the identity.
