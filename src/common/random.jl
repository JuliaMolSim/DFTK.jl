"""
Seeds the task local RNG across all MPI ranks.
A seed can be provided for reproducibility with previous runs
(for the same Julia version and Manifest.toml).
If no seed is provided, a random seed is generated on the master process.
The returned seed can be used to reproduce the run.

If any subtask is spawned, it will be seeded based on the task local RNG of its parent,
as explained in the documentation of [Random.TaskLocalRNG](@ref).
Seeding the task local RNG at the beginning of a computation is thus sufficient.
