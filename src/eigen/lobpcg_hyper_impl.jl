# Implementation of the LOBPCG algorithm, seeking optimal performance
# and stability (it should be very, very hard to break, even at tight
# tolerance criteria). The code is not 100% optimized yet, but the
# most time-consuming parts (BLAS3 and matvecs) should be OK. The
# implementation follows the scheme of Hetmaniuk & Lehoucq (see also
# the refinements in Duersch et. al.), with the following
# modifications:

# - Cholesky factorizations are used instead of the eigenvalue
# decomposition of Stathopolous & Wu for the orthogonalization.
# Cholesky orthogonalization is fast but has an unwarranted bad
# reputation: when applied twice to a matrix X with κ(X) <~
# sqrt(1/ε), where ε is the machine epsilon, it will produce a set
# of very orthogonal vectors, just as the eigendecomposition-based
# method. It can fail when κ >~ sqrt(1/ε), but that can be fixed by
# shifting the overlap matrix. This is very reliable while being
# much faster than eigendecompositions.

# - Termination criteria for the orthogonalization are based on cheap
# estimates instead of costly explicit checks.

# - The default tolerances are very tight, yielding a very stable
# algorithm. This can be tweaked (see keyword ortho_tol) to
# compromise on stability for less Cholesky factorizations.

# - Implicit product updates (reuse of matvecs) are performed whenever
# it is safe to do so, ie only with orthogonal transformations. An
# exception is the B matrix reuse, which seems to be OK even with very
# badly conditioned B matrices. The code is easy to modify if this is
# not the case.

# - The locking is performed carefully to ensure minimal impact on the
# other eigenvectors (which is not the case in many - all ? - other
# implementations)


## TODO micro-optimization of buffer reuse
## TODO write a version that doesn't assume that B is well-conditionned, and doesn't reuse B applications at all
## TODO it seems there is a lack of orthogonalization immediately after locking, maybe investigate this to save on some choleskys
## TODO debug orthogonalizations when A=I

# TODO Use @debug for this

Simple wrapper to represent a matrix formed by the concatenation of column blocks:
