For disentanglement procedure (12 bands to 8 MLWFs), add 

dis_win_max       = 16.47068d0   ! upper limit between 11th and 12th band
dis_froz_max      =  6.1172d0    ! frozen limit between 4th and 5th band
dis_num_iter      =  120
dis_mix_ratio     = 1d0

to the win file.

Also the guesses are for now gaussian with random centers. So you might have to generate a few Amn files to have matching results with QE.


call $ ./clean.sh to remove all the produced files at the end
