Determine the minimal grid size for the cubic basis set to be able to
represent product of orbitals (with the default `supersampling=2`).

Optionally optimize the grid afterwards for the FFT procedure by
ensuring factorization into small primes.

The function will determine the smallest parallelepiped containing the wave vectors
 ``|G|^2/2 \leq E_\text{cut} ⋅ \text{supersampling}^2``.
For an exact representation of the density resulting from wave functions
represented in the spherical basis sets, `supersampling` should be at least `2`.
