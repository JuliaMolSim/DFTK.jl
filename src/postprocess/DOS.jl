    NOS(ε, basis, orben; smearing=basis.model.smearing, T=basis.model.temperature)

The number of Kohn-Sham states in a temperature window of width T around the energy ε
contributing to the DOS at temperature T.

This quantity is not a physical quantity, but rather a dimensionless approximate measure
for how well properties near the Fermi surface are sampled with the passed `smearing`
and temperature `T`. It increases with both `T` and better sampling of the BZ with
``k``-Points. A value ``\gg 1`` indicates a good sampling of properties near the
Fermi surface.
