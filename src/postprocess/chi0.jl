Compute the independent-particle susceptibility. Will blow up for large systems.
For non-spin-polarized calculations the matrix dimension is
`prod(basis.fft_size)` × `prod(basis.fft_size)` and
for collinear spin-polarized cases it is
`2prod(basis.fft_size)` × `2prod(basis.fft_size)`.
In this case the matrix has effectively 4 blocks, which are:
```math
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
    (χ_0)_{αα}  & (χ_0)_{αβ} \\
    (χ_0)_{βα}  & (χ_0)_{ββ}
\end{array}\right)
```

# αmn = ratio * fn / (fn^2 + fm^2)
# fn αmn = ratio * fn^2 / (fn^2 + fm^2)

# - It gives a vanishing contribution fn αmn for empty states
#   (note that α itself blows up, but it's compensated by fn)
# - In the case where fn=1/0 or fm=0 we recover the same formulas

# - When n=m it gives the correct contribution
