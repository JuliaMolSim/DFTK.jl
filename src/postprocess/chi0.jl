Compute the independent-particle susceptibility. Will blow up for large systems.
For non-spin-polarized calculations the matrix dimension is
`prod(basis.fft_size)` × `prod(basis.fft_size)` and
for collinear spin-polarized cases it is
`2prod(basis.fft_size)` × `2prod(basis.fft_size)`.
In this case the matrix has effectively 4 blocks, which are:
```math
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
    (χ_0)_{αα}  & (χ_0)_{αβ} \\
    (χ_0)_{βα}  & (χ_0)_{ββ}
\end{array}\right)
```
