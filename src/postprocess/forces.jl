Compute the forces of an obtained SCF solution. Returns the forces wrt. the fractional
lattice vectors. To get cartesian forces use [`compute_forces_cart`](@ref).
Returns a list of lists of forces
`[[force for atom in positions] for (element, positions) in atoms]`
which has the same structure as the `atoms` object passed to the underlying [`Model`](@ref).
