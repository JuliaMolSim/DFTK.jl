# Refinement of some quantities of interest (density, forces) following the
# strategy described in [CDKL2022].
# We use a different sign convention than [CDKL2022] for corrections δX,
# such that X + δX is the refined quantity.
#
# The overall strategy is to perform a first SCF,
# transfer the result to a new basis set with a larger Ecut,
# then perform an approximate first order correction in the larger space.
#
# To compute the first order correction ("refinement") δP in the larger space,
# one needs to invert (Ω+K)δP = -R(P) where (Ω+K) is the Hessian matrix and
# R(P) = [P, [P, H(P)]] is the residual.
# See newton.jl for an explanation of these quantities.
#
# The basis elements of the smaller basis set are called low frequency (_1 suffix).
# The additional basis elements are all high frequency (_2 suffix).
# We approximate (Ω+K)_22 by M_22 which is cheap to compute and invert, and (Ω+K)_21 by 0.
# The motivation is that the dominant term in Ω+K for high frequencies is the kinetic energy.
#
# The metric operator M is as follows:
# M applied to the n-th band is defined by
#   M_n = P^⟂ T_n^{1/2} P^⟂ T_n^{1/2} P^⟂,
# with the diagonal operator
#   T_n = kinetic energy + mean kinetic energy of n-th band.
# To invert M_n effectively, we use P^⟂ T_n^{-1} P^⟂ as the preconditioner.
#
# Solving the system then amounts to computing
#   δP_2 = -M^{-1}_22 R_2(P)
#   δP_1 = (Ω+K)^{-1}_11 (-R_1(P) - (Ω+K)_12 δP_2)
# The inversion of (Ω+K)_11 is roughly as expensive as the SCF on the low frequency space.
