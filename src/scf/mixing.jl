# Mixing rules: (ρin, ρout) => ρnext, where ρout is produced by diagonalizing the
# Hamiltonian at ρin These define the basic fix-point iteration, that are then combined with
# acceleration methods (eg anderson). For the mixing interface we use `δF = ρout - ρin` and
# `δρ = ρnext - ρin`, such that the mixing interface is
# `mix_density(mixing, basis, δF; kwargs...) -> δρ` with the user being assumed to add this
# to ρin to get ρnext. All these methods attempt to approximate the inverse Jacobian of the
# SCF step, ``J^-1 = (1 - χ0 (vc + K_{xc}))^-1``, where vc is the Coulomb and ``K_{xc}`` the
# exchange-correlation kernel. Note that "mixing" is sometimes used to refer to the combined
# process of formulating the fixed-point and solving it; we call "mixing" only the first part
# The notation in this file follows Herbst, Levitt arXiv:2009.01665

# Mixing can be done in the potential or the density. By default we assume
# the dielectric model is so simple that both types of mixing are identical.
# If mixing is done in the potential, the interface is
# `mix_potential(mixing, basis, δF; kwargs...) -> δV`
