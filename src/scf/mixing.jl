# Mixing rules: (ρin, ρout) => ρnext, where ρout is produced by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian at ρin
# These define the basic fix-point iteration, that are then combined with acceleration methods (eg anderson)
# All these methods attempt to approximate the inverse jacobian of the SCF step, J^-1 = (1 - χ0 vc)^-1
# Note that "mixing" is sometimes used to refer to the combined process of formulating the fixed-point
# and solving it; we call "mixing" only the first part

# The interface is `mix(m, basis, ρin, ρout) -> ρnext`
