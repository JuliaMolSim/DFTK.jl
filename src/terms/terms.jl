### Terms
# - A Term is something that, given a state, returns a named tuple (E, hams) with an energy
#   and a list of RealFourierOperator (for each kpoint).
# - Each term must overload
#     `ene_ops(term, basis, ψ, occ; kwargs...)` -> (E::Real, ops::Vector{RealFourierOperator}).
# - Note that terms are allowed to hold on to references to ψ (eg Fock term),
#   so ψ should not mutated after ene_ops

# The Hamiltonian is defined as half of the gradient of the energy
# with respect to the density matrix sum_n fn |ψn><ψn|.
# In particular, dE/dψn = 2 fn |Hψn> (plus weighting for k-point sampling)
abstract type Term end

# Terms that are non-linear in the density (i.e. which give rise to a Hamiltonian
# contribution that is density-dependent or orbital-dependent as well)
abstract type TermNonlinear <: Term end

### Builders are objects X that store the term parameters, and produce a
# XTerm <: Term when instantiated with a `basis`

    compute_kernel(basis::PlaneWaveBasis; kwargs...)

Computes a matrix representation of the full response kernel
(derivative of potential with respect to density) in real space.
For non-spin-polarized calculations the matrix dimension is
`prod(basis.fft_size)` × `prod(basis.fft_size)` and
for collinear spin-polarized cases it is
`2prod(basis.fft_size)` × `2prod(basis.fft_size)`.
In this case the matrix has effectively 4 blocks

\left(\begin{array}{cc}
    K_{αα} & K_{αβ}\\
    K_{βα} & K_{ββ}
\end{array}\right)
