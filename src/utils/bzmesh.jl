    bzmesh_uniform(kgrid_size)

Construct a uniform Brillouin zone mesh for sampling the ``k``-Points. The function
returns a tuple `(kcoords, ksymops)`, where `kcoords` are the list of ``k``-Points
and `ksymops` are a list of symmetry operations (for interface compatibility
with `PlaneWaveBasis` and `bzmesh_irreducible`. No symmetry reduction is attempted,
such that there will be `prod(kgrid_size)` ``k``-Points returned and all symmetry
operations are the identity.

    bzmesh_ir_wedge(kgrid_size, lattice, composition...; tol_symmetry=1e-5)

Construct the irreducible wedge of a uniform Brillouin zone mesh for sampling ``k``-Points.
The function returns a tuple `(kcoords, ksymops)`, where `kcoords` are the list of
irreducible ``k``-Points and `ksymops` are a list of symmetry operations for regenerating
the full mesh. `lattice` are the lattice vectors, column by column, `composition` are pairs
representing a mapping from `Species` objects to a list of positions in fractional
coordinates. `tol_symmetry` is the tolerance used for searching for symmetry operations.
