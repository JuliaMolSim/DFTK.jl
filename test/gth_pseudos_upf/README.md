These files are converted from the cp2k repo (which has the Goedecker-type pseudos
in GTH format to UPF. We use them for consistency checks of the PspUpf pseudo
implementation against the PspHgh implementation (using the standard cp2k
pseudos of the "cp2k.nc.sr.lda.v0_1.semicore.gth" family from PseudoPotentialData)
